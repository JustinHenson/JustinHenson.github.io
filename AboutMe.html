<h2 id="who-am-i-">Who am I?</h2>
<p>If you didn&#39;t catch it already, my name is <em>Justin Henson</em> and I go to school at the University of Missouri, Columbia, currently pursuing a Bachelors in Information Technology.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do-outside-of-school">What I do outside of school</h2>
<p>When I&#39;m not doing school work I can be found working at Best Buy. I work anywhere from 2 to 5 days a week. I recently got put into a new position at Best Buy working in the precinct of GeekSquad, where I work on clients&#39; computers and help resolve any issues people may have on their personal devices. It has been a great way for me to become more comfortable on computers and learn all kinds of new skills. I hold another job at the high school I attended, where I teach the drumline, as well as run all the sounds for the group. I have been playing music for 13 years now, and I find it rewarding to be able to give back to a program that did so much for me when I was in school. Besides work, I enjoy playing disc golf with friends, making music, and spending some alone time playing games.</p>
