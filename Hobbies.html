<p><h2 id="-_music_-"><strong><em>Music</em></strong></h2></p>
<p>I have been playing music since I was <strong>8 years old</strong>, and it has been a passion ever since. Throughout my experience within music, I picked up Bass Guitar, Guitar, Piano, and a little bit of drumset. I grew up learning Jazz, and was very involved in the jazz program at my high school, and have been a part of several jazz groups where I was lucky enough to go play at several events for my school, and have been able to play at <a href="https://americanjazzmuseum.org/content/gem-theater-rental">The Gem Theatre</a> in Kansas City. Since graduating high school I haven&#39;t had as many opportunities to play out, but I always hop on the chance to jam with some friends.</p>

<h2 id="-_building-computers_-"><strong><em>Building Computers</em></strong></h2>
<p>When I was a kid I was so fascinated by computers and wanted to figure how they worked. Fast forward to my junior year of high school and I was taking an AutoCAD class, and I enjoyed it so much I talked to my parents into allowing me to build my own PC. Since then I have helped a number of my friends build their own systems, and have learned so much about the technology that is on the market right now.</p>

<h2 id="-_wood-working_-"><strong><em>Wood Working</em></strong></h2>
<p>The idea of being able to build something yourself that is functional, attractive, and will last, excites me. I got experience with woodworking when I was in middle school, my older brother wanted to customize one of his guitars, so it became a project that my dad, brother, and myself, worked on together. It was so much fun, and it opened my eyes to a whole new world of possibilities. As of recently, I built a two-level TV stand for my room, so I had space for my speakers and game consoles underneath my TV. There is so much to learn, but at the end of the day it is just a hobby of mine, and I am in no rush to master the craft.</p>
