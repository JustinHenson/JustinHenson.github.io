<ul>
<li>End the semester with a <strong><em>3.5 GPA</em></strong></li>
<li>Go to the gym at least <strong>3 times a week</strong> starting in November</li>
<li>Write a piece of music for drumline</li>
<li>Read a book before the new year</li>
<li>Go and see a concert before the year ends</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some goals that I have made for myself since Fall semester started, and I work towards them everyday. I have found that setting goals for big things like school grades, or small things like going to see a concert, help me achieve a better balance in my life.</p>
